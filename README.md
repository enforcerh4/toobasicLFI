# TOO  BASIC  LFI  TOOL  DOCUMENTATION

Too Basic LFI tool is another stupid shell script to automate some boring repetitive commands. 

I'm not responsible for its use. Use it at your own risks. 

Trying to compromise systems you haven't been expressely authorized to is forbidden and may result in legal consequences.

## Main Features

I just noticed that there were no simple tool to discover relatively simple LFI without testing them one by one. 

This software is able to detect local file inclusions, using path traversal violation. 

Supported files (to increment): 


```/etc/hosts

/etc/passwd

/etc/shadow

```

Supported files are automatically tested and displayed if found
